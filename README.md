**CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT:**

Chess Engine developed in C++; move generation and storage implemented using bitboards. Evaluation function and negamax alpha beta pruning to be implemented for the move selection process.

Ignore board.h and board.cpp files, initial implementation utilized 2D arrays but inefficiencies in time and space as well as difficulties realized in the evaluation position led to a decision to drop that implementation.

Implemention of the GUI has not been implemented; will be implemented after completing working model of the engine.
